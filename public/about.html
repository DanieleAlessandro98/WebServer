                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Bari Aldo Moro.</p>

                <p>Since my childhood I have
                    always been fascinated by computers and technology. My curiosity, combined with an interest in video
                    games, led me to discover what was behind these games. This led me to explore the world of computer
                    science and to take my first steps in programming.</p>

                <p>Over the years I have had the opportunity to develop and expand my skills. I have participated in
                    several projects, both in teams and individually, where I have applied and refined my knowledge
                    following agile methodologies. I am passionate about open source projects where I can share
                    experiences and learn from others. I am constantly striving to improve my skills and grow
                    professionally as a software engineer.</p>

                <p>During my university career I had the opportunity to put my knowledge into practice. I wrote code to
                    design, implement and maintain systems for a multiplayer MMO game based on a client-server
                    architecture.</p>

                <p>In my free time I like to be in contact with nature and animals. The relationship with the
                    environment relaxes me and gives me a rejuvenating break from the digital world.</p>
